  bodyDescription: `In response to an initial lack of sales, my first strategic move involved the development of a new website, conity.fr. This landing page was designed with a specific purpose in mind: to serve as a powerful tool for our sales team, enabling them to engage builders and construction companies, our valued clientele.<br/><br/>

  The implementation of this website yielded positive results, paving the way for a subsequent phase of my role. I primarily focused on the maintenance of our Symfony platform, a critical component of our SaaS product. In addition, I embarked on the significant task of implementing automated end-to-end testing procedures, leveraging the capabilities of Selenium to ensure the quality and robustness of our software.`,
  contextDescription: `In early stage of development, Conity was approaching the building sector, pioneering a transformative <b>connection between homebuilders and individuals seeking to construct their dream homes</b>. In the formative stages of the company, with a lean yet dedicated team of just five individuals, our primary objective was to optimize our sales initiatives.`,

  bodyDescription: `Within the development teams at Maskott, we employ the agile methodology. Our teams typically consist of a manager, a product owner, and several developers working on each project. While some developers possess complementary skills, with certain individuals leaning towards backend development and others towards frontend development, my own experience has involved working across both domains, albeit with a stronger emphasis on frontend development.`,
  contextDescription: `Maskott is a Lyon-based startup founded two decades ago by Pascal Bringer, a former teacher within the national education system, with the primary goal of digitizing the learning experience within schools.
  Initially, the company produced physical digital media, including CDs integrated into textbooks used in schools during the early 2000s. However, as the years passed, Maskott shifted its focus towards creating a web platform to comprehensively digitize all educational content used by students in schools. This initiative aimed to replace traditional textbooks and exercise books, which can be burdensome for children and result in substantial logistical and environmental costs.<br/><br/>
  Originally developed in C# using the Orchard framework, Maskott introduced a digital solution that gained adoption in 20% of secondary schools in France by the year 2020.<br/>
  In pursuit of technical optimization and enhanced visual appeal, the decision was made to undertake a complete overhaul of the application in 2021, transitioning to the React technology stack. It is within the framework of this project that my involvement takes place.<br/>`,

  bodyDescription: `<b>Requirement Clarification</b>: I initiated in-depth discussions with stream managers to understand their specific needs and the goals of the project. By thoroughly clarifying the specifications, we laid a solid foundation for the development process.<br/><br/>

  <b>Dashboard Website Development</b>: I took on the challenge of designing and developing a comprehensive dashboard website from scratch. This involved creating a user-friendly interface that provided advanced functionality for managing and viewing esports tournaments.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Overlay Creation</b>: To enhance the viewer experience, I designed and developed overlay web pages. These overlays presented real-time information in a visually appealing manner, immersing esports fans in the gaming action.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Modular Overlay Design</b>: For greater flexibility and seamless integration with OBS, I designed modular overlays. By utilizing tools like Photoshop, I ensured that scene transitions during streaming were smooth and captivating.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Frontend Development</b>: The frontend of the website was my responsibility. I implemented it using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, guaranteeing that users had access to a responsive and intuitive platform.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Backend Integration</b>: I integrated the backend using the Start.gg API through GraphQL. This empowered the website to deliver up-to-the-minute data on scores, player tags, team details, stream queues, and match information. This made the platform highly interactive and engaging for the esports community.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Deployment</b>: After extensive development and testing, I successfully deployed the website. This made it easily accessible to viewers, stream managers, and tournament participants worldwide, ensuring that they could enjoy a seamless and feature-rich experience.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>Key Features</b>:<br/><br/>
  
  I ensured real-time score updates were an integral part of the platform.<br/>
  Player tags were meticulously implemented for easy identification.<br/>
  Team information for players was made readily available.<br/>
  A stream queue management feature was added for enhanced control.<br/>
  The platform provided in-depth match information for the convenience of both viewers and participants.<br/>
  By taking on this project, I aimed to elevate the esports streaming experience, making it more immersive and interactive for all stakeholders involved.<br/><br/>
  
  By employing different colors for the icon and notifications, we effectively kept users informed at all times, allowing them to join with a single click from their browser and ensuring they didn't miss any of his valuable content.`,
  contextDescription: `In Esports and Smash tournaments, live streaming is a standard practice to reach a broader audience and enhance the competitive spirit for both players and spectators. Typically, for setting up such streams, we rely on a director who operates OBS to switch scenes, update player scores, and provide match-related information, all aimed at ensuring an optimal viewer experience. The objective of this project was to streamline the responsibilities of these directors by automating a significant portion of their tasks through the start.gg API, the platform where tournaments take place.`,
